# Data-Management
Eloitte Project

part of the SDAIA Bootcamp for Data Management, I was tasked with a mandatory capstone project. The focal point of my project was the development of a robust data sharing framework tailored for fintech companies, ensuring alignment with the regulations set by Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL).
The project consisted of four key deliverables:
* a visually Data Sharing Framework map.

* a comprehensive Policy and Procedures document.

* an Excel file detailing the alignment between Sama and PDPL articles.

* a visually informative Data Flow Chart. Additionally, a RACI Matrix was implemented to ensure clear role distribution.
